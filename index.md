# Robert's User Page!
## Welcome to my Github page
### Hopefully you will learn some things about me here!

I am a third year **Math-CS** major. I have already had *one internship* and I will be having another one this summer.
I was ~~19~~ 20 when I wrote my first line of code, that is because I was initially a history major before I switched into 
**Math-CS**.
